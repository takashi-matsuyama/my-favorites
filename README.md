Save user's favorite posts and list them.

## Description

Save user's favorite posts and list them.
This plugin is simple. You can save the user's favorite posts just a install and display them anywhere you want with just a shortcode.
The logged-in user's data is saved in the user meta. Other user's data is saved to Web Storage (localStorage).

## Usage

* **Shortcode:** `[ccc_my_favorite_select_button post_id="" style=""]`
* **Shortcode:** `[ccc_my_favorite_list_menu slug="" text="" style=""]`
* **Shortcode:** `[ccc_my_favorite_list_results class="" style=""]`

For pages with a shortcode for list view ([ccc_my_favorite_list_results]).

"Load More" is displayed with "posts_per_page".
It will be displayed when the user has more favorite posts than "posts_per_page".

* **Shortcode:** `[ccc_my_favorite_list_results posts_per_page="10"]` default is 100 posts.

You can display the post's "excerpt".
This value is the char length.
If not needed, use "no excerpt" or "0".

* **Shortcode:** `[ccc_my_favorite_list_results excerpt="30"]`

If you want, you can change the code for list view yourself.

* **Shortcode:** `[ccc_my_favorite_list_custom_template style=""]`

For pages with a shortcode for custom list view ([ccc_my_favorite_list_custom_template]).
Add the function (`function ccc_my_favorite_list_custom_template( $my_favorite_post_id ) { }`) for your list view to `your-theme/functions.php`.
`$my_favorite_post_id` is array.
`style="none"` excludes the default CSS for the list.

Detailed usage is under preparation.

## Installation

1. Upload `my-favorites` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use shortcodes to display the favorite posts list and an icon for save and a menu for link to list.
